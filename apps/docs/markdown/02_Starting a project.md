**Lexicon projects are created by a site administrator.**

Contact a site administrator using the [feedback](/feedback/) page and request a new project giving the language name and 3 letter ethnologue code. 

The assumption will be that **the user requesting the creation of a new project will also be given permission to edit the project.** If this is not the case, or if additional team members need project permissions please include that information in the request.
