Building a minority language lexicon is a cyclical process of refining and discovering spelling. E ntries added to the lexicon may not be written "correctly" when they are first entered.

It is possible to mark lexicon entries as checked. When this is done a tick appears next to the entry in the lexicon search view.

Exporting spell check can also be limited to just checked entries. Deselecting checked entries only includes all words, making the check marks optional.

## The review system

Entries marked for review will be displayed in the review list, along with the review comments and the user requesting the review. This enables team mates to tag entries they think needs updating and collaborate on improving spelling. Once the team agrees and the entry is updated and no longer marked for review it will be removed from the list.
