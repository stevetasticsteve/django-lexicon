The export page will allow lexicon data to be exported in different formats. The version number of the lexicon is updated every time a change is made to an entry. This version number is to allow you to see if you have already downloaded the most up to date spellcheck.

The current supported formats are:

 - [Libre Office](/docs/31_Libre office spellcheck) .oxt
 - [Paratext](/docs/32_Paratext spellcheck) .xml
 - [Microsoft word](/docs/33_Microsoft Word spellcheck) .dic

**Libre office is recommended as a word processor**. Libre Office uses hunspell and offers the best spellchecking features.
